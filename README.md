The most challenging code was enabling the capability to edit items inline. Additionally we encountered trouble getting our api data visualization to render.

## Key Takeaways

-Utilizing Third Party API's is not an easy task
-Organization of components and pages is essential to a functionaly react app
-Modern design and UI techniques
-Would still like to implement a feature or two but overall this is a great app in my opinion.
