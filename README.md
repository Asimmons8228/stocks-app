The most challenging code was enabling the capability to edit items inline. Additionally we encountered trouble getting our api data visualization to render.

The biggest issue that I faced was because of the API key. Initially I thought that there was an issue with how the API was being called (ex. if it was the routes, the handleSearch function, symbol properly displayed, if it was a chart rendering issue, etc.), however it turned out that the reason my data was not being called was due to the API limit. 


## Key Takeaways

-Utilizing Third Party API's is not an easy task
-Organization of components and pages is essential to a functionaly react app
-Modern design and UI techniques
-Would still like to implement a feature or two but overall this is a great app in my opinion.
